<h1>International Mother language Day- 21st February</h1><hr/>
<p> <u> আন্তর্জাতিক মাতৃভাষা দিবস,</u> is a worldwide annual observance held on 21 February to promote awareness of linguistic and cultural diversity and to promote. <br> <b>First announced by UNESCO on 17 November 1999,</b> [1] it was formally recognized by the United Nations General Assembly with the adoption of UN resolution 56/262[2] in 2002. <br> Mother Language Day is part of a broader initiative "to promote the preservation and protection of all languages used by peoples of the world" as adopted by the UN General Assembly on 16 May 2007 in UN resolution 61/266, <br> [3] which also established 2008 as the International Year of <del> [4][5][6][7]</del> The idea to celebrate International Mother Language Day was the initiative of Bangladesh. <br> In Bangladesh, 21 February is the anniversary of the day when the people of Bangladesh (then East Bengal of Pakistan) fought for recognition for the Bengali language.[8] It is observed all over the world.</p> <br> <br>

<h2>History</h2>
<p> <strong> 21 February was declared to be the International Mother Language Day by <abbr title="United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization">UNESCO</abbr>  in 1999.</strong> <br> It has been observed throughout the world since 21 February 2000. The declaration came up in tribute to the Language Movement done by the Bangladeshis (then the East Pakistanis). <br>

  When Pakistan was created in 1947, it had two geographically separate parts: East Pakistan (currently known as Bangladesh) and West Pakistan (currently known as Pakistan). <br> The two parts were very different from each other in the sense of culture and language. The two parts were also separated by India in between. <br>
  
  In 1948, the Government of Pakistan declared Urdu to be the sole national language of Pakistan, even though Bengali or Bangla was spoken by the majority of people combining East Pakistan and West Pakistan. <br> The East Pakistan people protested, since the majority of the population was from East Pakistan and their mother language was Bangla. <br> They demanded Bangla to be at least one of the national languages, in addition to Urdu. The demand was raised first by Dhirendranath Datta from East Pakistan on 23 February 1948, in the constituent Assembly of Pakistan. <br>
  
  To demolish the protest, the government of Pakistan outlawed public meeting and rallies. The students of the University of Dhaka, with the support of the general public, arranged massive rallies and meetings. <br> On 21 February 1952, police opened fire on rallies. Abdus Salam, Abul Barkat, Rafiq Uddin Ahmed, Abdul Jabbar and Shafiur Rahman died, <br> with hundreds of others injured. This was a rare incident in history, where people sacrificed their lives for their mother tongue.[9][10] <br>
  
  Since then, Bangladeshis celebrate the International Mother Language Day as one of their tragic days. They visit the Shaheed Minar, <br> a monument built in memory of the martyrs and its replicas to express their deep sorrow, respect and gratitude to them.[citation needed][11][12] <br>
  International Mother Language Day is a national holiday in Bangladesh. The resolution was suggested by Rafiqul Islam and Abdus Salam, <br> Bengalis living in Vancouver, Canada. They wrote a letter to Kofi Annan on 9 January 1998 asking him to take a step for saving the world's languages from extinction by declaring an International Mother Language Day. <br>  <mark>  Rafiq proposed the date as 21 February to commemorate the 1952 killings in Dhaka during the Language Movement. </mark><br>

  Languages are the most powerful instruments of preserving and developing our tangible and intangible heritage. <br> All moves to promote the dissemination of mother tongues will serve not only to encourage linguistic diversity and multilingual education but also to develop fuller awareness of linguistic <br> and cultural traditions throughout the world and to inspire solidarity based on understanding, tolerance and dialogue. <br>
  
  — From the United Nations International Mother Language Day microsite[13]
  Rafiqul Islam's proposal was introduced in the Bangladesh parliament and in due course (at the behest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina) <br> a formal proposal was submitted to UNESCO by the Government of Bangladesh. <br> The process of shepherding the proposal through UNESCO's regulatory system was undertaken by Syed Muazzem Ali, <br> then Bangladesh ambassador to France and Permanent Representative to UNESCO, and Tozammel Tony Huq, his predecessor, who was then a Special Adviser to UNESCO Secretary General Federico Mayor. <br> Finally on 17 November 1999, the 30th General Assembly of UNESCO unanimously resolved that <br> "21st February be proclaimed International Mother Language Day throughout the world to commemorate the martyrs who sacrificed their lives on this very day in 1952."[14]</p> <br> <br> <br> <br>

  <h2>Poem</h2>
 <h2 id="poem-name"> Amar Bhai'er Rokte Rangano Ekushey February</h2>
 <pre>  Can I forget the twenty-first of February
  incarnadined by the love of my brother?
  The twenty-first of February, built by the tears
  of a hundred mothers robbed of their sons,
  Can I ever forget it?
  Wake up all serpents,
  wake up all summer thunder-storms,
  let the whole world rise up
  in anger and protest against the massacre of innocent children.
  They tried to crush the demand of the people
  by murdering the golden sons of the land.
  Can they get away with it
  at this hour when the times are poised
  for a radical change?
  No, no, no, no,
  In the history reddened by blood
  the final verdict has been given already
  by the twenty-first of February.
  It was a smooth and pleasant night,
  with the winter nearly gone
  and the moon smiling in the blue sky
  and lovely fragrant flowers blossoming on the roadside,
  and all of a sudden rose a storm,
  fierce like a wild horde of savage beasts.
  Even in the darkness we know who those beasts were.
  On them we shower the bitterest hatred
  of all mothers brothers and sisters.
  They fired at the soul of this land,
  They tried to silence the demand of the people,
  They kicked at the bosom of Bengal.
  They did not belong to this country.
  They wanted to sell away her good fortune.
  They robbed the people of food, clothing and peace.
  On them we shower our bitterest hatred.
  Wake up today, the twenty-first of February.
  do wake you, please.
  Our heroic boys and girls still languish in the prisons of the tyrant.
  The souls of my martyred brothers still cry.
  But today everywhere the somnolent strength
  of the people have begun to stir
  and we shall set February ablaze
  by the flame of our fierce anger.
  How can I ever forget the twenty-first of February?
  </pre>
